summary: I became an admin for my college's Game Development Club, but I was sorely dissapointed.

This was the second year as well as the second try to gather a team for game development if you came from "Taking on Everything". Quite frankly it was probably my best chance to gather a team, but the more I spent time around them I realized that pretty much everyone was an introvert that attempted to reach out, but stifled their words too hard. I had become an admin for the club on a whim to foster talent by trying to change the learning style from an extremely casual gathering of people who did nothing then eventually quit to a extreme learning style club that would engage only the strongest wills. However, it was denied. The owner of the club didn't want it to become too strenuous, but the club eventually fell apart and became abandoned because the engagement was nonexistent. Everyone left and I was unable to find anyone because of how distant everyone felt. I just wanted some warmth I suppose so nobody really caught my eye. It was at this time where I started to ramp up my digital art training because the only thing that is permanent is the experience from your dilligence.
