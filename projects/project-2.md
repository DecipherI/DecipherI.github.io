Since 1.5 years ago, I vowed to become a one man indie game dev team. To sum up the story, the plan to do it in 4 years seemed to be lost. My judgement deemed digital art to be the partest of them all because without amazing art an indie game is nothing. If I wanted to control the artistic direction of my own game I needed to step up and train heavily and extremely quickly, because I only had 4 years back then. However, everytime I trained I got way too excited with what I thought was amazing progress to awaken to the days showing me how slow I really was. People drew at rates 10X or even 20X my speed. They drew atleast 100X more than I did and I was so satisfied with some meager progress. I needed to train even harder, even faster, even more than I had before. In order the reach great heights I had to train like people in art schools.

So I did just that. 8 Hours a day of digital art training while balancing everything else in my life. I did it sucessfully a few times and I won't doubt the possibilities anymore. If anything I'll achieve this heavy level of consistency immediately and keep this up. I'll become the solo game dev.

If I can perservere through heard hours, perhaps I can make this work.
