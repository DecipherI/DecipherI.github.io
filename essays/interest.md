Learning software engineering the traditional way through classes is nice, but of course there are many other things I have in mind that synergize really well with me learnign programming.
Just by a few advanced classes in computer science I can see the immense flaws in the time complexity of my code. Things that are extremely simple become even simpler in the hands of a seasoned professional.
The absolute difference is staggerring between me and a seasoned programmer, which is why it's perfect as a learning environment to get the best possible methods to code even faster.
Just the pure knowledge itself makes me feel a little like I've ascended or something, but there are other things as well other than a job.

Someday I would like to just simply chill doing the things I like doing and pursing the things I want to pursue. One of them is game development. The core that holds the game together is hundreds of lines of interconnecting code that connect everything seamlessly.
The core of a good game is good mechanics, good gameplay, and of course it being online. Things like mechanics or gameplay is something that can be finely tweaked or found simply, however when you add internet capabilities into the mix you get an extreme amount of coding complexity.
An immense amount of data is being sent and recieved and is infinitely increasing with the issues increasing as well. Time complexities of all functions need to be at the absolute lowest or the lag time will completely destroy the immersive experience of a real time game.
Thus, I'd like to learn a great deal of extremely fast algorithms for internet server use.
