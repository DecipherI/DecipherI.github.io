## Do Research Before You Ask For Help
The one thing that pisses people off is being bombarded by incompetent questions without end. The issue is not the question itself, but rather the fact that the answers to which are extremely likely to be found online. Asking too many questions will set people off very quickly, but if you narrow those questions down to a select few that stretch the limits of your knowledge, we happen to not get coworkers to hate us. And so the one thing you need to do first, after tormenting yourself on why your code doesn't work, is research. There are millions of people onto/in the path of software engineering and chances are there will be a couple posts online having the same issue. Find the answers you seek and now you can advance. 

## Simplify The Issue To It's Very Roots
What if the question is for a particularly unique problem? Well you can't just say "It's not working" can you? The one thing you don't want to give another person is an entire block of code to wonder "What am I looking at?". Many times they will just pack up their bags and leave or online they might not respond. Break down the status of "Not Working" into several possibilities of errors. Hammer away all possibilities you can until you're left with issues you can't solve. Not only will this be much faster for the person helping you, but you yourself will also grow through every issue you fix. Always strive to do what you can to the maximum limit until you rely on someone else. Teamwork is important in large scale projects, but individual capabilities are also massively important. There will be times where you can't rely on anyone. It's at these points where all your experiences shine through.

## However Time Is Limited, Don't Be Stuck Forever
Projects and Code all have deadlines. For self-projects you have the limit of a small amount of time everyday if you have a job or a commitment. For code in buisinesses, you have an actual time limit imposed upon you. The goal should always be to break down problems to it's core issue, but when you take way too much time just to fulfill those guidelines you just go way too far with the commitment. Don't let fear of your co-workers hating you cloud your mind. It's likely you won't have the time and everyone above you knows exactly how to do what you need. The clock is ticking and you must go. You might anger a few people, but you just have to ramp up your knowledge and consistency. Over time you'll become faster with the process until other people will wonder "What went wrong with this" just like you once did. No matter how empty or full your knowledge pool is, there will always be questions beyond you. If you must ask, then you must.

## Immerse Yourself In Your Field For The Future
Day after day new technological prowess is born from the sweat of developers and engineers hard at work. No matter what field you are in, there is bound to be new advances in technology that will swallow you up if you ignore it. The skill cap of everything is always rising as more and more information, techniques, leaguages, and frameworks are made. Nothing in life is permanent and that includes your knowledge. The genuises of today will always be overshadowed with those of tomorrow. If you stay in the past especially in a rapidly changing field like IT, the sheer amount of advancement will completely outdate your knowledge. One must always improve oneself in the present and also in the future.
