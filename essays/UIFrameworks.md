## What's the Difference between HTML and UI Frameworks?
Raw HTML requires extensive knowledge to create great websites that usually take an immense amount of code for simple objectives. UI Frameworks formulates all the code, style, and scripts you need into a few links, and javascript file to import. To sum it up simply, the written code of html in UI Framework style completely overwhelms raw html in speed and usability. Creating good looking UI with frameworks would only take a few lines, whiles you would need to meticulously go into your .css file for styles to fine tune margins, borders, shapes, buttons... the list stretches to infinity. There's a heavy amount of work that goes into styling UI and these UI Frameworks nullify this vast need for knowledge to put in simple arrangements of words and pictures.

## Frameworks are not Limitless however...
Although each reputable UI Framework has a vast amount of styles, scripts, and classes programmed into it, they all lack personal freedom. All technology evolves on the foundation of other's that they are inspired by and the trends of today limit the frameworks we have to what the majority think is good looking. To rely on a framework is to be chained down into a single style of website design. Once you feel these constraints, learning HTML to the limit is something you might want to consider to be interested in. There are so much things that cannot be created by UI Frameworks alone. There are Image Slideshows(that can be cycled through automatically and manually), side bars, personalized animations,... the list goes on. If you ever feel constrained, perhaps it's the time to create your own.

## Worth it to learn?
Well of course. Learning a framework is extremely simple because they're all class based, which means to learn them all you simply need to keep track of the class names you need to use. Usually websites come with the script activation lines and examples for class use, so getting into it is extremely simple. It might take a small amount of time to get used to, but this isn't a new language. In a few weeks you'll be a-okay and the more frameworks you encounter the faster learning them becomes. But these frameworks aren't the only thing you should learn! There are a myriad of effects and animations you can do outside of UI Frameworks you can do with raw HTML that the cultivation of many peoples' hard effort have brought to light! Never stop learning and combine this knowledge to create amazing things. Watch videos on this and comprehend for the internet is our greatest ally, but becoming lax makes it our greatest bane. A moment of respite blows away a foundation of efforts.
