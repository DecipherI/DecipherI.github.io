## Coding Standards
### If There Were No Standards
What would programming be if there were no standards? Absolute chaos. In measurement systems there is already a rift between these two standards, metric and what america uses, which only serve to make the world more confusing. In this application it's a heavily basic disruption which isn't very big of an issue, but when you get into programming where figuring out what another person's code does makes this small disruption a cryptic task. A standard is required for quick flexible exchanges between programmers, without it advances within time limits become nearly impossible.

### However, Coding Standards Aren't Only For Other People
They are also for people who get into learning new programming languages that seem to overflow in the world of programming. No matter if you are new or a veteran to programming, standards will help you code the most optimal way to gain the best performance. Every language is different from each other, but some overhaul the system and completely rework programming itself for the fastest time complexity of different fields. Once you come across one of these languages, you have coding standards to guide you instead of you having to spend countless months more than you have to. Learn the basic framework to the programming language then coding standards will repeatedly enforce the rules, thus getting you more comfortable with it in record time.

### Post-ESLint Usage Thoughts
After trying ESLint, Coding Standard Correction Tool, my code was completely swamped with code style errors. It was as if someone gave you some papers with size 12 font. However, after the corrections you become able to see the code with must greater clarity. This readability definitely is much better in terms of when you have other people working together with you. I plan to have a big project with some friends to join me and code standards definitely will make reading other people's code a much better time. I can tell you that much for sure.
